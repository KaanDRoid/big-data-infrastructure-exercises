= Big Data Infrastructure Exercises

We'll use this repository through our course.
Starting it from a small application to have something
bigger and more complex.

You'll learn to develop an API, the common intrface between software systems,
package it and deploy it to the cloud (AWS) and finally how we can scale
and better automate the data-intensive parts.

== Installation

* Use python 3.11 or 3.12
* https://github.com/pypa/pipx#install-pipx[Install `pipx` ðŸ”—]
* Install poetry (dependency manager) `pipx install poetry`

Run `poetry install`

If you need to add any package, just execute `poetry add the_dependency` or add it inside `pyproject.toml`
to the `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` section.
Then run `poetry update`


TIP: Try not to use Windows and use WSL2 instead: a linux "layer" for windows.

== Running the app

```shell
poetry run fastapi dev bdi_api/app.py


# And the tests
poetry run pytest
```


== How will the exercises be evaluated?

The exercises are a bit different so evaluation will be specified in each `bdi_api/sX/README.adoc` file. 



== Libraries

https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/[FastAPI] is one of the best libraries for building an API with Python.
It has a great documentation and enables us to build
type safe and documented APIs easily.



== Data
Use the `data/` folder to store your data.
It will not be uploaded to any git repository.
